Linear Regression using Scikit-Learn: A Simple Tutorial
Overview
If you are new to scikit-learn and regression analysis, this tutorial will help you learn by implementing simple linear regression models. For those who want to delve deeper, follow the upcoming notebooks where we will explore more complex regression techniques and models.

Dataset
In this notebook, we will use the regression-example dataset, a popular dataset used for regression tasks.
Notebook and Code
The goal of this notebook is to train and evaluate four different regression models to predict the target variable based on various predictors. We will start with simple data exploration using visualization libraries like seaborn to understand the relationships between the features and the target. For this tutorial, we will use the following regression models:

Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
By visualizing the dataset, we can observe the correlations among features and their distributions with respect to the target variable. This will help in understanding the behavior of our regression models.

Prerequisites
Before we start, make sure you have the following installed:

Python (preferably version 3.x)
scikit-learn: To install, run pip install scikit-learn
pandas: To install, run pip install pandas
seaborn: To install, run pip install seaborn
matplotlib: To install, run pip install matplotlib
Basic knowledge of Python and experience with data manipulation using pandas is helpful but not required.

Getting Started
Load the dataset using pandas and explore its structure.
Visualize the data using seaborn and matplotlib to identify relationships and potential trends.
Preprocess the data by splitting it into training and testing sets.
Train and evaluate the four regression models using scikit-learn:
Linear Univariate Regression
Linear Multivariate Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Compare performance of these models based on metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values.
Conclusion
By the end of this tutorial, you will have a better understanding of simple regression techniques and how to implement them using scikit-learn. You will also see how different regression models compare in terms of performance on a standard dataset.

Have fun and happy coding!
